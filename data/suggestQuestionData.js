It could help identify the most common specializations and areas where more doctors are needed.",
//     "**Doctor Clinic Association Graph**: This graph would examine the relationship between 'DOCTOR_ID' and 'CLINIC_ID' to illustrate which clinics have the most doctors and which doctors are associated with multiple clinics. It could aid in understanding clinic resource allocation and doctor availability.",
//     "**Doctor Patient Load Graph**: This graph would investigate the relationship between 'DOCTOR_ID' and 'PATIENT_ID' to display the number of patients assigned to each doctor. It could assist in identifying doctors with high patient loads and facilitate resource planning to ensure adequate patient care."

export const SuggestQuestionData = `Based on the provided database structure, I recommend the following three analytical graphs:

1. **Doctor Specialization Distribution Bar Chart**: This graph will display the distribution of doctors across different specializations, with the x-axis representing the specialization IDs and the y-axis representing the count of doctors. This will help in understanding the concentration of doctors in specific specializations.

2. **Clinic-Doctor Association Heatmap**: This graph will show the association between clinics and doctors, with clinics on one axis and doctors on the other. The heatmap will help identify which clinics have the most doctors associated with them and which doctors are associated with multiple clinics.

3. **Doctor-Patient Interaction Network Graph**: This graph will illustrate the interactions between doctors and patients, with nodes representing doctors and patients, and edges representing the interactions between them This will help in understanding the complex relationships between doctors and patients, and identifying patterns or clusters of high interaction.`
